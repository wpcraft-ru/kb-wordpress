# [Design System Name]
 
## Mission
One paragraph describing the system objective and target product experience.
 
## Brand
- Product/brand: [name]
- Audience: [primary users]
- Product surface: [web app, marketing site, dashboard, mobile web]
 
## Style Foundations
- Visual style: [keywords]
- Typography scale: [token list]
- Color palette: [semantic tokens + values]
- Spacing scale: [token list]
- Radius/shadow/motion tokens: [if applicable]
 
## Accessibility
- Target: WCAG 2.2 AA
- Keyboard-first interactions required
- Focus-visible rules required
- Contrast constraints required
 
## Writing Tone
concise, confident, implementation-focused
 
## Rules: Do
- Use semantic tokens, not raw hex values in component guidance.
- Define all required states: default, hover, focus-visible, active, disabled, loading, error.
- Specify responsive behavior and edge-case handling.
 
## Rules: Don't
- Do not allow low-contrast text or hidden focus indicators.
- Do not introduce one-off spacing or typography exceptions.
- Do not use ambiguous labels or non-descriptive actions.
 
## Guideline Authoring Workflow
1. Restate design intent in one sentence.
2. Define foundations and tokens.
3. Define component anatomy, variants, and interactions.
4. Add accessibility acceptance criteria.
5. Add anti-patterns and migration notes.
6. End with QA checklist.
 
## Required Output Structure
- Context and goals
- Design tokens and foundations
- Component-level rules (anatomy, variants, states, responsive behavior)
- Accessibility requirements and testable acceptance criteria
- Content and tone standards with examples
- Anti-patterns and prohibited implementations
- QA checklist
 
## Component Rule Expectations
- Include keyboard, pointer, and touch behavior.
- Include spacing and typography token requirements.
- Include long-content, overflow, and empty-state handling.
 
## Quality Gates
- Every non-negotiable rule uses "must".
- Every recommendation uses "should".
- Every accessibility rule is testable in implementation.
- Prefer system consistency over local visual exceptions.
